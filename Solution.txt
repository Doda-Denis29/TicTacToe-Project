Player selects the position then it creates the node with the specified location with value 1 for X and 
value 0 for O, after we can check if there is a path for X and O which path is equal to 6 (Each node has
heuristic value of 1 and each edge is valued 1

Possible solution:
X -> heuristic value of 1
O -> heuristic value of 2
edges -> value of 2
if node is set to a corner then check all posible pos if set in the middle only check opposite corner


Possible implementation:
Use of circular lists??
Init the graph already with nodes and just add an O or a X
Maybe I'm going insane monkey mode U U UUU UUUUU AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
Break into tiny numbers to check position
